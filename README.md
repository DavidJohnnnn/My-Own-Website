# My-Own-Website
My own personal resume website, filled with useful information about me to prospective employers as well as anyone interested.

Built with a lot of stuff, mostly HTMl, CSS and JavaScript. Check out the JavaScript for the functions that let me add the moving components, check out the HTML for the Bootstrap components I used and check out the CSS for the styling.
